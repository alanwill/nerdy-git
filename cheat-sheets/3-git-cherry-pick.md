# git cherry-pick

### Reference docs

Given one or more existing commits, apply the change each one introduces, recording a new commit for each. This requires your working tree to be clean (no modifications from the HEAD commit).

### Simple cherry pick

```
git cherry-pick <commit-SHA>
```

### Cherry pick multiple commits

```
git cherry-pick <commit-SHA-1> <commit-SHA-2>
```
