</p>

**What This Session is About**

From rebase and rerere to submodule and subtree, this session will show you common use cases for some of the less common Git commands. This hands-on session will include a cornucopia of nerdy delights as we round out the bunch with reset and filter-branch. This session is ideal for intermediate to advanced Git users who aren't afraid of a little command line.
